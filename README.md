- The 3D additivist Cookbook -

This archive contains most of 3D models from The 3D Additivist Cookbook in .stl and .obj format in addition to a 3D-PDF of the Cookbook published on December 2, 2016 by Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke.

The 3D Additivist Cookbook is a compendium of strategies that aim to turn 3D printing into a tool for emancipation, activism and disruption. It brings together speculative texts, 3D models, prototypes, recipes and practical suggestions.

The 3D Additivist Cookbook was designed with The Laboratory of Manuel Bürger (Manuel Bürger, Simon Schindele and Alexander Papoli), and will be published by The Institute of Network Cultures (Amsterdam) as a 3D-PDF and print-on-demand publication. The Cookbook was produced as part of transmediale 2016’s Vilém Flusser Residency Programme for Artistic Research with support from the Ernst Schering Foundation (Berlin) (transmediale is a project of Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH in cooperation with the Haus der Kulturen der Welt funded by the German Federal Cultural Foundation).
